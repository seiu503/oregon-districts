To update code:

1. edit files in sandbox
2. add to outbound changeset, include test for each updated file in changeset
3. upload to production
4. cancel/delete existing scheduled job from Scheduled Apex jobs list (look for job belonging to user Sarah Schneider, named Oregon Districts Update)
5. validate/deploy inbound changeset
6. review code in production by opening files in prod dev console and confirm that changes look ok
7. restart scheduler: Developer Console => Debug => Open Execute Anonymous Window:

OregonDistrictsJobScheduler.start();
